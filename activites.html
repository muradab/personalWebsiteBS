                It's found at 6 kilo Addis Ababa universty main campus.
                The institutes building was built by Italin invasion in 1930's.
                later it become a royal palace after the emperor came from 
                England.After a decades the emperor left the palace moved to 4 kilo.
                the emperor just not left the palace he changed it to a university
                kedamawi Haile Silase University and now it becomes Addis Ababa University
                <br>
                me and my friends dormitary were at 4 kilo. we went there for  registration
                office for a withdrawal step. the entrance of the museum show some artcle
                or history about the place written in english. some of best ethiopian authors
                clothes and some of their utilities are found at the groud floor.
                at first floor thier is a tour that  from birth to death in beautiful way.
                some of the emperors things like their gifts and bed are also in the 
                museum. not only just this their are many ethiopian traditional
                 musical instruments like 'kebero', 'washint' 'kirar'.  
                 <br>
                 It was a fun day and we learned so many things from the museum.
                 I know I didn't mention everything at the museum because I want to
                 readers explore them.

                    It was a shiny bright day me and my dormmates get ready to go 
                    class. Unfortunately the lecturer was absent so we were bored and
                    when we were going to our dorms we found other lads and decided to visit the museum. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                As one can undertand from the name its one of the big museums.it has many 
                collections of items ranging from rings to crowns to stones of ancient ages.
                it also have many fossil findings from lucy to ardi selam etc.we got chances to take a pic with
                the fossils.unlike the other places
                this museum has many visitors specially tourists.

                    <br>
                    It might seem weird but most of us even though our dorms were at 4 kilo
                    and the center was found at the same compound. may be the museum and our 
                    dormitary may be at distant place but not knowing about it until the end 
                    of the first year was quiet amazing.we were also surprized about this
                    after what we see in the  museum.

                    <br>
               The museum is not very big  as compared to the above museums
               but it has very fascinating things(well, dead animals). It 
               starts from the smallest insects to large reptiles.
               there is room of birds were different species are found 
               and its very beutiful. there is a room full of snake species and 
               one of my friend was freaking out .
